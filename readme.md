Work-in-progress.

TODO
----
 -  See what Linux/XDG folks use.

        data:   Not ~/.local/var?
        config: Not ~/.local/etc?
        cache:  Not ~/.local/tmp?

    Maybe three modes: xdgmode = 'strict', 'compat', None?
 - Less repetition in dir methods?
 - `.../var/db`?
 - `.../var/log`?
 - No `prog` namespacing for cache directory?
